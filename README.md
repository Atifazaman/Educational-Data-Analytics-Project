# EducationAnalytics Smart Contract

## Vision

The `EducationAnalytics` smart contract aims to revolutionize the management and analysis of educational data by leveraging blockchain technology. It provides a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof system for recording student grades, querying academic records, and generating insightful reports. This smart contract ensures data integrity and accessibility while enhancing educational data management.

## Flowchart

Below is a high-level flowchart outlining the interaction with the `EducationAnalytics` smart contract:

```
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
|   User (Owner)    |       |  EducationAnalytics |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
           |                        |
           |    Add Grade            |
           |------------------------>|
           |                        |
           |    Get Grades           |
           |<------------------------|
           |                        |
           |    Generate Report      |
           |------------------------>|
           |                        |
           |     Report Summary      |
           |<------------------------|
```

## Contract Address

**Note:** This contract is intended for deployment on an Ethereum-based network. Replace `0xYourContractAddress` with your actual deployed contract address once deployed.

```plaintext
Contract Address: 0xYourContractAddress
```

## Contract Details

- **Contract Name:** `EducationAnalytics`
- **Compiler Version:** Solidity ^0.8.0
- **Access Control:** Only the contract owner can add grades and generate reports.

### Key Functions

- **`addGrade(address _student, string memory _subject, uint256 _score)`**: Adds a grade for a student. Restricted to the contract owner.

- **`getGrades(address _student) public view returns (Grade[] memory)`**: Retrieves all grades for a specified student.

- **`generateReport(address _student)`**: Generates a summary report for a student, including average scores and total subjects.

### Events

- **`GradeAdded(address indexed student, string subject, uint256 score)`**: Emitted when a new grade is added.

- **`ReportGenerated(address indexed student, string reportSummary)`**: Emitted when a report is generated.

## Future Scope

1. **Enhanced Analytics**: Implement more advanced analytics features, such as trend analysis and predictive modeling.
2. **User Roles**: Introduce various user roles and permissions, allowing for more granular access control.
